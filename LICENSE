Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work"). Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use of widely recognized and standardized legal tools.

Owners who wish to contribute a Work to the Commons with no conditions attached to such contribution may do so by waiving all of their rights to the Work worldwide, under copyright and related law, whether vested or contingent, to the fullest extent allowed by law. By doing so, these owners contribute to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.

Public License Fallback

Should any part of the waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted, and the owner hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise all rights and powers granted by the owner, to the extent possible under applicable law.
