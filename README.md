# Basic Glossary -(GPT-4o)

## 1. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
The broader field of creating machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.

- **Artificial General Intelligence**  
  A theoretical form of AI capable of understanding and performing any intellectual task that a human can.

- **Artificial Narrow Intelligence**  
  AI designed to perform a specific task or a limited set of functions with high efficiency.

---

## 2. Machine Learning (ML) *(a subset of AI)*
A method of training computers to learn from data and improve their performance without explicit programming.

- **Supervised Learning**  
  A machine learning approach where models are trained using labeled input-output pairs.

- **Unsupervised Learning**  
  A machine learning method that finds hidden patterns in data without labeled outputs.

- **Reinforcement Learning**  
  A learning technique where an agent learns to make decisions by receiving rewards or penalties.

---

## 3. Data Science *(interdisciplinary field using ML and statistics)*
The interdisciplinary field that extracts knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.

---

## 4. Neural Network-Based AI *(a method used in ML and generative AI)*
These are architectures modeled after the human brain.

- **Artificial Neural Networks**  
  Computing systems inspired by the human brain that recognize patterns and learn from data.

---

## 5. Generative AI *(built on ML and often neural networks)*
AI systems that create new content such as text, images, or music based on learned patterns.

- **Large Language Models**  
  Deep learning models trained on vast text datasets to understand and generate human-like language.
